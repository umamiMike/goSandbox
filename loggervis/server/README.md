# Server for aecompare
This should probably be renamed, but as I am not sure what use the tool is I am not sure what it should be called.

## To install
- `go get` for dependencies
- `./server` to start it up
it will be running on `http://localhost:9099` 

## Current State
It is purpose built for my vagrant files currently, just change the key value pairs in the var DB starting at line 17 to the db you want to access.  These will corrospond the to db string in the client form.
